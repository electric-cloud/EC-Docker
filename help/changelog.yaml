1.0.0:
  - Introduced the EC-Docker plugin.
1.0.1:
  - Discover procedure has been added.
1.2.0:
  - |
    Added support for deploying micro-services modeled in ElectricFlow to Docker. Deploying micro-services to the following Docker environments are supported:
    <ul>
      <li>Stand-alone Docker instances</li>
      <li>Docker Swarm</li>
      <li>Docker Enterprise Edition</li>
      <li>Windows Docker containers on Windows 2016</li>
      <li>Docker Swarm</li>
      <li>Docker Enterprise Edition</li>
      <li>Windows Docker containers on Windows 2016</li>
    </ul>

  - Added procedure <i>Undeploy Service</i> to undeploy a previously deployed service.
  - Added procedure <i>Remove Docker Service</i> to remove a service running on a stand-alone Docker host or a Docker Swarm cluster.
  - Removed support for using EC-Docker as a 'component' plugin. Micro-services based applications should be modeled as applications with services. The services can then be deployed using the native ElectricFlow services deployment capability.
1.2.1:
  - |
    Added support for Docker network creation.
    <ul>
      <li>For Stand-alone Docker instances, <i>Deploy Service</i> procedure creates a user defined bridge network if network name given in service mapping page. Procedure uses this network to deploy containers.</li>
      <li>For Docker Swarm instances, <i>Deploy Service</i> procedure creates a user defined overlay network if network name given in service mapping page. Procedure uses this network to deploy Docker Swarm services.</li>
    </ul>
1.2.2:
  - Registered the <i>Undeploy Service</i> procedure as an <i>Undeploy Service</i> operation to enable undeploying micro-services modeled in ElectricFlow from Docker using the service process.
  - Added <i>Create Ingress</i> and <i>Delete Network</i> procedures.
  - Added support for container update on standalone docker engine.
  - Added support for attaching additional networks during container update.
1.3.0:
  - Added <i>Import Microservices</i> procedure which can be used through the <i>Import Docker Compose file</i> catalog item in the <i>Containers</i> service catalog for creating microservice models in ElectricFlow.
  - Added <i>Artifact2Image</i> procedure.
  - Discover procedure is <i>Deprecated</i>. Use the <i>Import Microservices</i> procedure to create microservice models based on the given Docker Compose file contents
  - Added support for retrieving and creating the plugin configurations through the <i>Configurations</i> option on the application process step and the pipeline stage task editors.
1.4.0:
  - Previously deprecated <i>Discover</i> procedure has been removed. Use the <i>Import Microservices</i> procedure to create microservice models based on the given Docker Compose file contents.
  - Fixed the report link for unsupported tags that were not processed by the <i>Import Microservices</i>.
  - Configured the plugin to allow the ElectricFlow UI to create configs inline of procedure form.
1.5.0:
  - Plugin promotion time has been improved.
1.5.1:
  - Configurations can be created by users with "@" sign in a name.
1.5.2:
  - Images in the help file have been fixed.
1.5.3:
  - Renaming from "Electric Cloud" to "CloudBees".
1.6.0:
  - Provisioning of Binary Dependencies (for example Grape jars) in the agent resource, required by this plugin, is now delivered through a newly introduced mechanism called Plugin Dependency Management. Binary dependencies will now be seamlessly delivered to the agent resource from the Flow Server, any time a new version of a plugin is invoked the first time. Flow Repository set up is no longer required for this plugin.
  - Add checking connection while creating/editing a configuration.
1.6.1:
  - Renaming from "CloudBees Flow" to "CloudBees CD"
1.6.2:
  - Upgrading dependecies to address security issues.
1.6.3:
  - The documentation has been migrated to the main site.
1.6.4:
  - Support for "Artifactory Classifier" and "Artifactory Extract" fields was added to the Artifact2Image procedure
