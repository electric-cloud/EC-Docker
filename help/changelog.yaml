1.0.0:
  - Introduced the EC-Docker plugin.
1.0.1:
  - Discover procedure has been added.
1.2.0:
  - Added support for deploying micro-services modeled in ElectricFlow to Docker. Deploying micro-services to the following Docker environments are supported:
        Stand-alone Docker instances
        Docker Swarm
        Docker Enterprise Edition
        Windows Docker containers on Windows 2016
        Docker Swarm
        Docker Enterprise Edition
        Windows Docker containers on Windows 2016
  - Added procedure <i>Undeploy Service</i> to undeploy a previously deployed service.
  - Added procedure <i>Remove Docker Service</i> to remove a service running on a stand-alone Docker host or a Docker Swarm cluster.
  - Removed support for using EC-Docker as a 'component' plugin. Micro-services based applications should be modeled as applications with services. The services can then be deployed using the native ElectricFlow services deployment capability.
1.2.1:
  - Added support for Docker network creation.
  - For Stand-alone Docker instances, <i>Deploy Service</i> procedure creates a user defined bridge network if network name given in service mapping page. Procedure uses this network to deploy containers.
  - For Docker Swarm instances, <i>Deploy Service</i> procedure creates a user defined overlay network if network name given in service mapping page. Procedure uses this network to deploy Docker Swarm services.
1.2.2:
  - Registered the <i>Undeploy Service</i> procedure as an <i>Undeploy Service</i> operation to enable undeploying micro-services modeled in ElectricFlow from Docker using the service process.        
  - Added <i>Create Ingress</i> and <i>Delete Network</i> procedures.
  - Added support for container update on standalone docker engine.
  - Added support for attaching additional networks during container update. 
1.3.0:
  - Added <i>Import Microservices</i> procedure.
  - Added <i>Artifact2Image<i> procedure.
  - Internal improvements for 8.3 release.
