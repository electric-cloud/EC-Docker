1.0.0:
  - Introduced the EC-Docker plugin.
1.0.1:
  - Discover procedure has been added.
1.2.0:
  - |
    Added support for deploying micro-services modeled in ElectricFlow to Docker. Deploying micro-services to the following Docker environments are supported:
    <ul>
      <li>Stand-alone Docker instances</li>
      <li>Docker Swarm</li>
      <li>Docker Enterprise Edition</li>
      <li>Windows Docker containers on Windows 2016</li>
    </ul>
  - Added procedure <i>Undeploy Service</i> to undeploy a previously deployed service.
  - Added procedure <i>Remove Docker Service</i> to remove a service running on a stand-alone Docker host or a Docker Swarm cluster.
  - Removed support for using EC-Docker as a 'component' plugin. Micro-services based applications should be modeled as applications with services. The services can then be deployed using the native ElectricFlow services deployment capability.

1.2.1:
  - |
    Added support for Docker network creation
    <ul>
        <li>For Stand-alone Docker instances, <i>Deploy Service</i> procedure creates a user defined bridge network if network name given in service mapping page. Procedure uses this network to deploy containers.</li>
        <li>For Docker Swarm instances, <i>Deploy Service</i> procedure creates a user defined overlay network if network name given in service mapping page. Procedure uses this network to deploy Docker Swarm services.</li>
    </ul>
1.2.2:
  - Registered the <i>Undeploy Service</i> procedure as an <i>undeployService</i> operation to enable undeploying micro-services modeled in ElectricFlow from Docker using the service process.
  - Added <i>Create Ingress</i> and <i>Delete Network</i> procedures.
  - Added support for container update on standalone docker engine.
  - Added support for attaching additional networks during container update.

1.3.0:
  - Added <i>Import Microservices</i> procedure.
