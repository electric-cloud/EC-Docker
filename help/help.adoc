Plugin version @PLUGIN_VERSION@

Revised on September 16, 2020




== Overview








== Plugin Configurations
Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply
across some or all of the plugin procedures. They
reduce repetition of common values, create
predefined parameter sets for end users, and
securely store credentials where needed. Each configuration
is given a unique name that is entered in designated
parameters on procedures that use them.


=== Creating Plugin Configurations
To create plugin configurations in {CD}, do these steps:

* Go to **Administration** &gt;**Plugins** to open the Plugin Manager.
* Find the @PLUGIN_NAME@ row.
* Click *Configure* to open the
     Configurations page.
* Click *Create Configuration* as per the description of parameters below.



=== Configuration Procedure Parameters

COPY ${FILENAME} /var/lib/jetty/webapps/ROOT.war # FILENAME is the filename of artifact, e.g. hello-world.war
EXPOSE ${PORTS:8080} # Will use Ports parameter or 8080 by default
<% if (ENV) { %> # Will use Environment Variables parameter if provided
ENV ${ENV}
<% } %>

<% if (COMMAND) { %> # Will use Command parameter if provided
CMD [${COMMAND}]
<% } %>

 * For Stand-alone Docker instances, 
_Deploy Service_ procedure creates a user defined bridge network if network name given in service mapping page. Procedure uses this network to deploy containers.

 * For Docker Swarm instances, 
_Deploy Service_ procedure creates a user defined overlay network if network name given in service mapping page. Procedure uses this network to deploy Docker Swarm services.



=== EC-Docker 1.2.0

- Added support for deploying micro-services modeled in ElectricFlow to Docker. Deploying micro-services to the following Docker environments are supported:

 * Docker Swarm

 * Docker Enterprise Edition

- Added procedure 
_Remove Docker Service_ to remove a service running on a stand-alone Docker host or a Docker Swarm cluster.
