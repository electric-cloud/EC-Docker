overview: |
  Docker is designed to deliver your applications faster. With Docker, you can separate your applications from your infrastructure and treat your infrastructure like a managed application. Docker helps you ship code faster, test faster, deploy faster, and shorten the cycle between writing code and deploying it.
  With Docker, you can package an application will all its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Containers wrap your application in a complete file system that has everything it needs to run (code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and other components installed on a server.  The result is an application that will run the same, regardless of the environment on which it is running.
  For more information about Docker, go to the <a href="http://www.docker.com/">Docker home page</a>.
  Plugin also supports Docker engines in Swarm mode. The cluster management and orchestration features embedded in the Docker Engine are built using SwarmKit. Docker Swarm is a cluster of Docker engines, or nodes, where you deploy services. When you create a service, you specify which container image to use and which commands to execute inside running containers.
