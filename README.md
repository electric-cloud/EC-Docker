EC-Docker
============

EC-Docker plugin uses the Docker Engine API to deploy containers and services on a stand-alone Docker host or a Docker Swarm cluster.

## Build ##

1. Download or clone this repository
   `git clone https://github.com/electric-cloud/EC-Docker.git`

2. Build the plugin jar
   `./dev/build.sh` (in EC-Docker directory)

## Usage ##

1. Install the plugin jar in your local CloudBees CD server
   `./dev/build.sh --deploy`

2. Login to the CloudBees CD server. Navigate to *Administration->Plugins* and create a configuration for newly installed and promoted EC-Docker plugin.

## Prerequisites:
   + Docker engine must be accessible on TCP port.
   + For deploying services, a swarm cluster must already be setup. Use the following steps to setup a cluster.

        1. Install Docker on all machines that needs to be part of the cluster.
           Minimum version of Docker required for swarm is v1.12.
        2. Run the following command on any of the machines. The machine on which this command is run becomes the manager node.

           ```
           docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.99.100
            Swarm initialized: current node (dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz) is now a manager.
             
            To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:
             
                docker swarm join \
                --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex3nedyz0fb0xx14ie39trti4wxv-8vxv8rssmk743ojnwacrr2e7c \
                192.168.99.100:2377
             
            To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

           ```
        3. Join worker nodes. Run the following command on the rest of nodes.
           The command to run itself is reported as output of 'docker swarm init' command.
            ```
            docker swarm join \
              --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex3nedyz0fb0xx14ie39trti4wxv-8vxv8rssmk743ojnwacrr2e7c \
              192.168.99.100:2377
           ```
           
        4. Swarm cluster can also be setup on AWS from [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06XCFDF9K)


## Required files: 
   If docker engine is running behind TLS enabled endpoint, then CA root certificate, client private key and client certificate are required.
